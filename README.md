# KeepNotes
KeepNotes is a simple To-do list Android application.

## About the application
This project is an android application designed to keep track of tasks that need to be completed. This application will function similarly to a task manager, allowing users to enter tasks that they need to complete. Once they've completed their tasks, they can cross them off the list. It provides the features to search for tasks and edit the tasks.
